## **README: BMI Prediction Model**

### **Project Overview**
This project aims to classify individuals into BMI categories (`thin`, `normal`, `fat`) based on their height and weight using machine learning models. The dataset used is derived from `bmi.csv`, which contains three columns:
- `height` (in cm)
- `weight` (in kg)
- `label` (BMI category)

### **Steps Followed**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Features (`height` and `weight`) were normalized to values between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler.
   - The target column (`label`) represents the BMI category.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Three models were trained:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed for Logistic Regression using `GridSearchCV`.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The accuracy of each model was evaluated using a test dataset.
   - The best-performing model was Logistic Regression with an accuracy of **81.17%**.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The trained model was used to predict BMI categories for new inputs.

### **Results**
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 81.17%
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: 78.57%
- **Gradient Boosting Accuracy**: 77.92%

### **File Structure**
```
/project
├── bmi.csv               # Dataset
├── bmi_model.py          # Main script for training and prediction
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### **How to Run**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required Python libraries:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Train Models**:
   - Run the training script:
     ```
     python bmi_model.py
     ```

3. **Predict BMI**:
   - Use the script to predict new values. For example:
     ```python
     from bmi_model import predict_bmi
     predictions = predict_bmi([[160, 64], [180, 64], [170, 64]])
     print(predictions)
     ```

### **Future Enhancements**
- Implement more advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.
- Add polynomial features or feature interactions for better accuracy.
- Use ensemble methods (e.g., Stacking) to combine multiple models.
- Conduct a detailed analysis of misclassified cases for further improvement.
